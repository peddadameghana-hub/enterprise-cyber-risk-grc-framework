Enterprise Cyber Risk, Compliance & Data Governance Monitoring Framework
📌 Overview

This project implements a practical Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) monitoring framework designed to help organizations identify cyber risks, assess control effectiveness, and maintain audit readiness across hybrid cloud and on-prem environments.
The framework mirrors real-world Information Security, Risk, Compliance, and GRC workflows aligned with industry standards and regulatory expectations.

🎯 Objectives

Identify and assess information security and IT risks

Monitor control effectiveness and remediation status

Support audit readiness and compliance reporting

Strengthen data governance and security posture

Provide leadership with risk and compliance visibility

🔍 Key Features
🔐 Risk & Control Assessment

Performed IT and information security risk assessments aligned with:

NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)

ISO/IEC 27001

CIS Critical Security Controls

Identified risks related to:

Data integrity and availability

Access management

Logging and monitoring

Third-party/vendor data exposure

📋 Risk Register & Issue Management

Designed a centralized risk register capturing:

Inherent risk

Control effectiveness

Residual risk

Risk owner

Remediation actions and status

Tracked control gaps, findings, and corrective action plans (CAPs)

🧩 Compliance & Framework Mapping

Mapped security controls to regulatory frameworks:

SOC 2 (Trust Services Criteria)

PCI DSS (conceptual mapping)

HIPAA Security Rule (data protection principles)

Supported audit readiness through structured documentation and evidence mapping

🧪 Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM)

Simulated vendor risk assessments, including:

Security questionnaires

Risk scoring and tiering

Issue tracking and remediation recommendations

Assessed vendor risks impacting confidentiality, integrity, and availability

📊 Continuous Control Monitoring & Reporting

Built automated monitoring dashboards using SQL and Power BI to track:

Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)

Control failures and trends

Remediation progress

Produced executive-ready risk and compliance reports

🛡 Data Governance & Security Controls

Implemented data validation and reconciliation controls to ensure:

Accuracy

Completeness

Regulatory compliance

Defined policies and procedures for:

Secure data handling

Access management

Incident reporting and escalation

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Data & Analytics: SQL, Power BI, Microsoft Excel

Cloud (Conceptual): AWS S3, EC2
